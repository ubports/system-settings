  * Hi, this branch seeks to address most of the design changes to the
    Background panel in System Settings (post Malta) The current spec
    and designs are here:
    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Appearance#Phone.2BAC8-tablet Related bugs:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-system-
    settings/+bug/1297418 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-autopilot-
    tests/+bug/1322074 Changes: Removed all functionality and code
    related to changing scope background. Added autopilot tests. New
    header design that collapses/expands. Not part of this branch:
    Scaling in preview has not been implemented. It should have its own
    branch. After rotating the phone in system settings, the default
    background will appear to have been deselected. This is because the
    current background is now the default tablet background. Confirmed
    on mako. Will file bug. Thank you. (LP: #1322074)

    current approch is to list all the packages installing a copyright
    and build a model from that. When selecting one of them in the list
